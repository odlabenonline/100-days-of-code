<p>Previously, we saw that we can inject a header.html and footer.html using Jinja and the code might look something like this:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">{% include "header.html" %}
Web page content
{% include "footer.html" %}</pre><p><br></p><p>This is a really flexible way of using Jinja to Template a website. It means that if your header and footer stay the same then you can just insert them into all your webpages. </p><p><br></p><h4>Template Inheritance</h4><p>However, often you'll find that you actually want to use the same design template for your entire website, but you might need to change some code in your header or footer. In these cases, it's better to use <strong>Template Inheritance</strong> instead.</p><p>Template inheritance is similar to Class inheritance, you can take a parent template and extend its styling in your child web pages. </p><p><br></p><p>For example, if we create a base.html file that has the following code:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;title&gt;{% block title %}{% endblock %}&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&nbsp; &nbsp; {% block content %}{% endblock %}
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre><p>It has predefined areas (or blocks) where new content can be inserted by a child webpage inheriting from this template. </p><p>1. We could re-write the success.html page to inherit from this base.html template:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">#1.
{% extends "base.html" %}
#2.
{% block title %}Success{% endblock %}
#3.
{% block content %}
&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;div class="container"&gt;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;h1&gt;Top Secret &lt;/h1&gt;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/Ju7l5y9osyymQ" width="480" height="360" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/rick-astley-Ju7l5y9osyymQ"&gt;via GIPHY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
{% endblock %}</pre><blockquote><p> #1. This line of code tells the templating engine (Jinja) to use "base.html" as the template for this page.</p><p>#2. This block inserts a custom title into the header of the template.</p><p>#3. This block provides the content of the website. The part that is going to vary between webpages. </p></blockquote><p><br></p><p>2. CHALLENGE: Try doing the same thing for denied.html, making sure that it uses the base.html as the template and it has a custom title and content.</p><p>SOLUTION:</p><p><a href="https://gist.github.com/angelabauer/aa7a7516bf02b1f0f1769dadaf4e6cf4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://gist.github.com/angelabauer/aa7a7516bf02b1f0f1769dadaf4e6cf4</a></p><p><br></p><h4>Super Blocks</h4><p>When we inherit from Python classes, you often see <code>super.init()</code></p><p>The super keyword refers to the parent that the child is inheriting from. e.g If Simba inherits from Mufasa, then Mufassa is the super. </p><figure><img src="https://img-b.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-09-25_09-45-03-659bb054ab4ebba4b8aa3b27006b517d.gif"></figure><p>When we are inheriting templates. Sometimes, there's some part of the template that we want to keep, but we also want to add to it. So we can use super blocks in this case.</p><p>3. Add the following code to your base.html:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">&lt;style&gt;
{% block styling %}
body{
    background: purple;
}
{% endblock %}
&lt;/style&gt;</pre><figure><img src="https://img-b.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-09-25_09-46-43-4426405e7d610f950de5668efbdab551.png"></figure><p><br></p><p>I named this block "<code>styling</code>" but you can call it anything you want. </p><p>Just make sure that you close all blocks with <code>{% endblock %}</code></p><p>Now if you reload your website, you should see that both the success page and the denied page will have a purple background. (We covered inline, internal and external styling in the CSS section of this course - Day 43).</p><figure><img src="https://img-b.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-09-25_09-50-04-1c8a4d7d0764dffe30dcafbcf8145416.png"></figure><p><br></p><p>So now you can see how easy it is to modify all web pages in your website if you use the same template. But what if on the denied page we also wanted to make the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> red? We would need to modify the internal styling in the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag. But that code is in the base.html template. Luckily we have super blocks.</p><p><br></p><p>4. On the <strong>denied.html</strong> page, add a super block using <code>{&zwnj;{ super() }}</code>, this will inject all the code in the styling block to this child page. Then afterwards before the <code>{% endblock %}</code>, we can add some more styling to change the colour of the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>. </p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">{% block styling %}
   {&zwnj;{ super() }}
   h1 {
      color:red;
   }
{% endblock %}</pre><figure><img src="https://img-b.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-09-25_09-55-57-0a874fed5fa1ec534da7728285032d6b.png"></figure><p><br></p><p>Gist with code from this lesson:</p><p><a href="https://gist.github.com/angelabauer/9842d06ca3b5c1c6668bef0f7f0601cb" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://gist.github.com/angelabauer/9842d06ca3b5c1c6668bef0f7f0601cb</a></p>
