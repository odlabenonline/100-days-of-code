<p>One of the main reasons why we're using Flask-Bootstrap in this project is because it has one of the most convenient methods for generating forms with WTForms. </p><p>Literally, in 1 line of code, you can create your form. It's as simple as:</p><p><code>{{ wtf.quick_form(form) }}</code> </p><p>What this line of code will do is generate all the labels, inputs, buttons, styling for your form just by taking the WTForm object that was passed to the template (<code>form</code>).</p><p>You can simply delete the entire </p><p> element and add a line to inherit the wtf support from bootstrap and use the <code>quick_form()</code> to generate your <code>form</code>. </p><figure><img src="https://img-b.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-10-09_08-54-49-f15bd100e7d707ad323490428b60d378.png"><br></figure><figure><img src="https://img-b.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-10-09_08-52-58-7568ac735a87e526fffbba0f5395dfae.png"><br></figure><p><br></p><p>Run your code and see the entire form laid out for you with zero effort.

Because everything is dandy as long as it works. This quick_form is a black box, it's magic. Which is great, but what happens if your form breaks? What if it's not doing what you expect it to? how would you debug magic?</p><p>That's why it's so important to understand how things work under the hood. Once you understand it, you can take all the shortcuts. </p><p><br></p><p>You can find the completed project on Repl.it here:</p><p><a href="https://repl.it/@appbrewery/day-61-end" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://repl.it/@appbrewery/day-61-end</a> <br></p>
